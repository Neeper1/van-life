        <h1>Van Life Experiences</h1>

        <h2>A Brief Background</h2>
        <p>
            Living in a van with no water, no electricity, and no cabinet doors was my introduction to van life. Did I ever think I was going to
            be someone who lived out of a van for months? No. Did I think traveling in a van would include basic essentials? Yes. However,
            living without a water tank or a refrigerator for the first month and a half was shocking, but my understanding of my perceived
            needs compared to my actual basic needs to live are changed. I met my now boyfriend when I was living in Washington, DC, and before I knew it, I was in Miami, living
            near North Beach in an unfinished van while working remotely in a makers-space while my boyfriend frantically tried to make the shell of a van our home.
            It was quite a challenge. There were plenty of challenges such as our stick-on linoleum tiles falling off of the sub-straight in 100-degree weather 30 minutes
            after we painstakingly arranged them in the bathroom, or having to replace the entire plumbing system after leaking occurred on unfinished wood causing mold to grow.
             Hard lessons were learned and patience was tested, several times, but adventure and growth tend to always be paired with challenges.

        <h2>Tailoring Expectations</h2>
        <p>
            Though living in a van can seem glamorous from the many pictures and videos on Instagram, Pinterest, and YouTube, I found the
            reality much more humbling. Completing small tasks, such as making breakfast, held greater weight than making breakfast in a house
            with a kitchen that was made to accommodate moving around and multitasking. Van life made me pay attention to the mundane, forgettable
            aspects of life. My trips did change my life, but it was not a vacation. It was real life that was a little more challenging but extremely
            rewarding.
